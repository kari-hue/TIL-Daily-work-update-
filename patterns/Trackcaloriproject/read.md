## Track your calori project 

> An overview of the project

This project  mainly allows you to keep control of your eating habits. You will input the food that you ate along with it's calories that it carries then this app will store that value and sum of all the calories you have during your day and provides you with proper feedback.


> we have basically four functions


* Storage controller
  
  It stores the data 
  
* itemController
  
  Item controller 
  
* uiController

  controls the working of userInterface. 
  For e.g.
  Allows you to input the name of food,calorie related to that food and add display it in your UI

* appController
 
  App controller basically controls the overall app.

  Note: Here we use the concept of modules and these modules work with each other very closely
